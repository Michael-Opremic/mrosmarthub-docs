Test credentials
================

In order to test the available web services, we created a test account for all functions. The services can be used as:

+------+-----------+
| user | zzz001    |
+------+-----------+
| key  | keyzzz001 |
+------+-----------+

The resulting returns are static and in no way connected to the underlying database. Inputs will still be checked for validity and return corresponding status or error messages.
